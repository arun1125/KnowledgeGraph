### Analytics is a measure of your progress to a business goal

### What makes a good metric?
- Comparative - usually time based
	- 2% conversion is good but 2% growth month to month is **better**
- Understandable 
	- defines your business so people need to be able to understand what we're doing
- Ratios/Rates
- They Change how you behave
	- **If a metric won't change how you behave, it's a bad metric**

### Types of Metrics
Qualitative vs Quantative 

**Qualitative** - Feedback from interviews
- Unstructured
- Things you gather from feedback - Anecdotal
- Opinionated 
- Hard to aggregate
- Revealing 

**Quantative** - dont give you answers but help you answer better questions
- Numbers and stats 
- Hard facts

**Discover Qualitatively but prove Quantitatively**


## Case 1 - Airbnb
### Question - Do hosts with professional photography get more business?

Resulted in thousands of free bookings a month! (because revenue was that good 2-3x!!!)

## Vanity vs Actual Metrics
Vanity - metrics that are up and to the right, make you feel good but **DONT CHANGE HOW YOU ACT**

Actionable - helps you pick a direction and changes your behaviour **CHANGES HOW YOU ACT**


### Examples of Vanity Metrics
- Hits -> Foolish better to count people instead
- Page Views -> marginally better than hits but still better to count people
- Visits -> is one person visiting 100 times or are a 100 people visiting once?
- Users -> tells you nothing about what they did
- Followers/likes/friends -> count ACTIONS instead; How many followers would do your bidding?
- Logins -. what are they actually doing when logging in?



## Exploratory Vs Reporting
**Exploratory**: Speculative, tries to find unexpected or interesting insights *Cool stuff*
**Reporting**: Predictable, keeps you with normal, day-to-day operations *Neccessary Stuff*


### Case 2 - Circles of ~~friends~~ Moms!
Circles of friends grew of the back of facebook. 10 Million users in 2008 (which was huge for back in the 07/08 days)

The CEO could of left it there and called his business a success! BUUUUUUT but his engagement sucked. When he was trolling through his data he found that a lot of his users who actually engaged were MUMS! 

They engaged 50% more! (and a bunch of other shit to verify mums are in fact the users who actively engage)

So what did he do? 

He focused on mums! got rid of his other users. This move would have looked crazy from the outside looking in BUT thats the deception of vanity metrics. They're like instagram. We need to work with REAL measures of success. and so his circle of freinds became circle of moms (american innit). He grows to about 4 million users and then exits.


## Lagging vs Leading Metrics (or indicators)

**Lagging**: Historical Metric that shows you how you are doing. Reports the news -> EG Churn

**Leading**: Number today that shows a metric tomorrow. Makes the news -> EG Customer Complaints

Customer complaints leads to churn 

But you can act on Customer Complaints not churn.

You want to get to a point where you are figuring out the leading indicators. LAgging indicators are what start ups focus on but thats because of lack of data.



# [[Causal]] != Correlation

OMG WE SHOULD STOP SELLING ICE CREAM! (if we're stupid)

**Correlated** - Two variables that change in similar ways. Perhaps because they're linked with somthing else

**Causal** - An independant factor that directly impacts a dependant one

![[Pasted image 20220309203257.png]]

**Step 1**: Find Correlation
**Step 2**: Test Causality
**Step 3**: Optimize the causal factor

AT ANY POINT IN YOUR BUSINESS YOU HAVE ONE METRIC THAT MATTERS

Choose only **one metric** and draw a **line in the sand** (ie a target)
