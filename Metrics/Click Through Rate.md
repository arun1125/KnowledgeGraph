**Click Through Rate**
	- defined as $$ \frac{NumClicks}{NumImpressions} $$
	- What is an impression? 
		- it means a view eg: when a search engine results page loads and the user has seen the result you consider that as an impression

Problems with this metric
- This metric can count unsuccessful clicks as succesfull clicks
	- Think about searching for something on google and then clicking and link and realising it wasn't what you were searching for

How to overcome this? 
You can solve this issue by filtering your data only on successful clicks i.e. only consider clicks that have a long Dwell Time (defined in the below page)

[[Successful Session Rate]]



## ADS
This will measure the ratio of user clicks to ads
