Dwell Time is how long a searcher views a page after they clicked a link on search enginer result page (**SERP**)

Successful Sessions can be defined as the ones that have a click with a n second or longer dwell time! You can specify n in the grokking search example they used n = 10

Session Success Rate = $$\frac{NumOfSuccessfulSessions}{NumOfTotalSessions}$$
BUT 

A session can be successful without a click. 

Like when you ask google basic questions and it gives you an answer from wikipedia automatically

These are called 
**Zero-click searches**: A SERP may answer the searcher’s query right at the top such that the searcher doesn’t need any further clicks to complete the search.

[[Click Through Rate]] doesn't include it but Successful Sessions can count this as a positive sample by using the following 

**Time To Success**

 It is common for a user to need multiple searches to find what they're looking for (definitely me trying to fix a programming bug)

Time to Success is just how long it takes for a user to find what they're looking for 

Low number of queries per session is also a good proxy for a successful session!
