Types of Errors

# Type 1 Error - False positive
 A False positive error (type1) is when the data from the test shows that there actually is significance when in fact there isnt any.
# Type 2 Error - False Negative
A False negative error is when the data from the experiment shows that there isn't any significant difference between treatment and control when there actually is

The problem with Type 1 and Type 2 error is that it's a **TRADE OFF** like in so many other aspects of data science
