# Search
# Ranking
# Online
- Online Metrics will allow us to evaluate the model with real time data
- They are interaction metrics
- They allow us to evaluate the search session on _user actions_
## [[Click Through Rate]]
## [[Successful Session Rate]]
## [Time to Success]
# Offline
Offline will allow us to evaluate the model during the developmental phase on a predefined test set (which should not be included with in the model building process at all!) Once we have decent offline metrics we can then move our model to production to see how it performs on real time data
