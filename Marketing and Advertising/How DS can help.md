SO much data is collected at each step of the customer journey
Can use data science to optimize different parts like 

- extending the top funnel
- answer questions such as: 
	- Who are your most promising customers? 
	- What choice alternatives do consumers of your product have? 
	- How do people feel about your brand?
	-  What other products do your customers want to buy?



Equally important as predicting these segments is understanding “why.” Data scientists look for causal relationships that growth marketers can then reverse engineer into an effective campaign. For example, let us hypothesize that clicks and conversion rate are positively correlated. The data scientist can test if that is true with a regression analysis, then the growth marketer, in partnership with the data scientist, can come up with experiments to test which campaigns produce more clicks, therefore a higher conversion rate.
